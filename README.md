# Urdu Language Hate and Threat Detection

This project focuses on detecting **abusive** and **threatening language** in **Urdu** using both **boosting-based** and **BERT-based** machine learning models.

## 🎯 Objective

To improve classification **accuracy** and **reduce loss** using advanced NLP techniques and compare performance between traditional and transformer-based approaches.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `UrduHate/`: Models and data for hate speech detection
- `UrduThreat/`: Models and data for threat detection
- `Project_Report.pdf`: Full academic report

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Transformers (mBERT, UrduBERT)
- XGBoost, LightGBM
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📊 Results

Each folder contains:
